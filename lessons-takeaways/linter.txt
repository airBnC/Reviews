Linter notes:

First, if you haven't, install the linter package for your IDE (or make sure it has one)
You'll have to do this for sublime, it might be easier for VS code

Then install a linting framework.  There's ESLint or JSHint.  We'll use ESLint.  We'll use Sublime's version.
:SublimeLinter-eslint -> find that as a package and install it in your sublime package manager

At this point you should have some basic linting going on

But we want to give it airbnb's rules to lint by

There are more packages to install.
Make sure you either install them all globally or all locally.
Or else they won't talk to each other.

An aside:
ESlint will look to see what rules you have in your .eslintrc.js local file
If there's nothing in there, it'll default to looking globally for the rules
(I think)

Install eslint globally

Install the airbnb package globally:
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-airbnb

It'll give you some more peer dependencies to install.  Install them per the list that you get in the terminal.
npm install -g eslint
npm install -g eslint-plugin-import
npm install -g eslint-jsx-a11y
npm install -g eslint-plugin-react

when you hit: cannot find module 'babel-eslint'
install it again
npm install -g babel-eslint

This should work!  If it doesn't, then you're well on your way..
