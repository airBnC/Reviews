# AirBnC

> AirBnC is, as you might guess, a clone of AirBnB.  For this front-end focused project, each group member picked a single module from the website to re-create using their own code.  I chose the Reviews module.

For this project, I: create and populate a MySQL database with fake review data; create a server in Node using Express with specific endpoints to serve up that data; build a React App that mimicks the Reviews module from the AirBnB website.
